CREATE A DATABASE AND USER
    - Log in to your MySQL database as a user which can create databases and set privileges
	- Example in MySQL:
		- CREATE DATABASE stfquiz;
		- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON stfquiz.* TO 'stf' IDENTIFIED BY 'stf';
	- To import the database, in the shell type (the stfquiz.sql-file is the file contained in the STFquiz installation):
		- `mysql -u stf -pstf stfquiz < stfquiz.sql`
    - Create a file named dbdetails.php and put it in the "htmlpages" directory
        - Look at dbdetails_example.php in the same directory for inspiration

INSTALL FPDF
	- Go to http://www.fpdf.org/en/download.php
	- Download v1.7 (known to work) or latest
	- Untar/unzip it
		- `tar xzvf fpdf17.tgz`

	- Copy the main file, "fpdf.php" and the directory named "font" into the "htmlpages" directory of your STFquiz installation
